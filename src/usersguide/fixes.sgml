	<para>
	In specific configurations, when you run "rocks sync users", you
	could see the error message:
	</para>

	<para>
	<computeroutput>
	411-alert: error while loading shared libraries: librocks.so: cannot
	open shared object file: No such file or directory
	</computeroutput>
	</para>

	<para>
	This occurs when 'ldconfig' is not run during the post installation.
	The fix is to ensure ldconfig is run at the end of an installation
	for all nodes.
	</para>
</listitem>

<listitem>
	<para>
	Fixes to the Rocks Command Line and 411-master program to fully support
	channel bonding on the frontend.
	</para>
</listitem>

<listitem>
	<para>
	When only one alias was specified for a host (with the command:
	<computeroutput>rocks add host alias</computeroutput>), the entry
	in <computeroutput>/var/named/private.domain</computeroutput> would
	have the format similar to
	<computeroutput>compute-1-0 CNAME ('c1-0',)</computeroutput>.
	</para>

	<para>
	The fix to the Rocks Command Line now properly outputs
	<computeroutput>compute-1-0 CNAME c1-0</computeroutput>.
	</para>
</listitem>

<listitem>
	<para>
	Clients were unable to use the Rocks Command Line.
	This was because a file in /etc/ld.so.conf.d was not installed on
	the clients that allowed mysql client code to find its libraries.
	</para>

	<para>
	Clients can now run Rocks Command Line commands.
	</para>

<para>
	Kernel Roll
</para>

<itemizedlist>

<listitem>
	<para>
	There was a code in rocks-tracker that wasn't properly reconstructing
	the 'peers' circular list when that list was expanded.
	This could cause several MD5 checksum errors on installing nodes
	because an installing node would ask for a peer and the tracker would
	send stale peer data to the installing node.
	</para>
</listitem>

<listitem>
	<para>
	In the case where one had a 64-bit frontend and 32-bit compute nodes,
	the messages exchanged between the tracker-server and the
	tracker-clients on installing nodes would be misaligned and installing
	nodes were incapable of finding (and thus, incapaable of downloading)
	their packages.
	</para>

	<para>
	All tracker messages are now properly aligned between 32-bit and 64-bit
	machines.
	</para>
