	Within a node XML file, values can be retrieved as
	&lt;var name="Service_Component"/&gt;.

	<arg type='string' name='service'>
	Defines the service name. e.g., service=Kickstart.
	</arg>

	<arg type='string' name='component'>
	Defines the component name. e.g., component=PublicDNS.
	</arg>
	
	<arg type='string' name='value'>
	Defines the value for the variable.
	</arg>

	<param type='string' name='service'>
	Can be used in place of service argument.

	<param type='string' name='component'>
	Can be used in place of component argument.

	<param type='string' name='value'>
	Can be used in place of value argument.

	<param type='string' name='appliance'>
	If supplied, restricts to the named appliance.
	See 'rocks list appliance' for a listing of appliances.

	<example cmd='set var service=Condor component=Master value=localhost'>
	Set the variable name &lt;var name="Condor_Master"/&gt; to 'localhost'.
