 	Interface that should be updated. This may be a logical interface or 
 	the mac address of the interface.

 	<arg type='string' name='mac'>
	The mac address of the interface. Usually of the form dd:dd:dd:dd:dd:dd
	where d is a hex digit. This format is not enforced. Use mac=NULL to
	clear the mac address.
