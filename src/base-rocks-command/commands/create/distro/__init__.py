	The version of the distribution. The default is the native
	version of the machine.
	</param>

	<param type='string' name='rolls'>
	A list of rolls that should be included in the distribution. This
	must be a list separated by spaces of the form: rollname,version.
	For example: rolls="CentOS,5.0 kernel,5.0". The default is to
	include all the enabled rolls for the native architecture. To
	get a list of enabled rolls, execute: "rocks list roll".

	<param type='string' name='root'>
	The path prefix location of the rolls. The default is:
