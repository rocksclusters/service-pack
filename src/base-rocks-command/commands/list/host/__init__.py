# unify the physical node and VM node boot action functionality
#
# - all bootaction's are global
#
# - the node table has a 'runaction' (what bootaction should the node do when
#   a node normally boots) and an 'installaction (the bootaction for installs).
#
# - the 'boot' table has an entry for each node and it dictates what the node
#   will do on the next boot -- it will look up the runaction in the nodes table
#   (for a normal boot) or the installaction in the nodes table (for an install).
