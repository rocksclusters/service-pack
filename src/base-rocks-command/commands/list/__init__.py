# dear mason,
#
# there are rocks commands that don't provide a 'header' parameter, yet, and
# here's the funny part, they still expect output.
#
# with love, greg. :-)

# Revision 1.7  2008/03/06 23:12:55  mjk
# Added column level filtering of output for list commands.
#
# New params
#   output-header=BOOL
#   output-col=NAME,NAME,...
#
# Now can turn off the header line with output-header=no and can select
# which columns get printed with output-col.  For example:
#
# rocks list roll output-col=arch output-header=no
#
# Will just print the arch (not even roll name) for all the rolls on the
# cluster.
#
# TODO: Where to document, not going to touch every list command!
