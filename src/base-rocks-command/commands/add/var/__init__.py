	Add variables to the Rocks key/value database. Variables are
	defined as quad of (Appliance, Service, Component, Value). 
	Within a node XML file, values can be retrieved as
	&lt;var name="Service_Component"/&gt;.

	<arg type='string' name='service'>
	Defines the service name. e.g., service=Kickstart.
	</arg>

	<arg type='string' name='component'>
	Defines the component name. e.g. component=PublicDNS.
	</arg>
	
	<arg type='string' name='value'>
	Defines the value for the variable.
	</arg>

	<param type='string' name='service'>
	Can be used in place of service argument.
	</param>

	<param type='string' name='component'>
	Can be used in place of component argument.
	</param>

	<param type='string' name='value'>
	Can be used in place of value argument.
	</param>

	<param type='string' name='appliance'>
	If supplied, restricts to the named appliance.
	See 'rocks list appliance' for a listing of appliances.
	</param>
		
	<example cmd='add var service=Condor component=Master value=localhost'>
	Add the variable name &lt;var name="Condor_Master"/&gt; to 'localhost'.
	</example>

	<example cmd='add var Condor Master localhost'>
	Same as above.
	</example>

	<example cmd='add var service=Condor component=Master value=localhost appliance=compute'>
	Add the variable name &lt;var name="Condor_Master"/&gt; to 'localhost'
	and associate it with only compute appliances.
	</example>
