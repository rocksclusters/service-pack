# put in code to dynamically configure the static-routes file based on

#
# Revision 1.3  2009/06/19 21:07:25  mjk
# - added dumpHostname to dump commands (use localhost for frontend)
# - added add commands for attrs
# - dump uses add for attr (does not overwrite installer set attrs)A
# - do not dump public or private interfaces for the frontend
# - do not dump os/arch host attributes
# - fix various self.about() -> self.abort()

# - checkpoint for route commands
