# Bug fix. DHCP filename by default is always the
# pxe boot file. In this case, "pxelinux.0"; Never kickstart.cgi
#
# Revision 1.22  2010/07/19 18:34:02  anoop
# Individually set "kickstartable", "dhcp_filename" and "dhcp_nextserver"
# attributes for every host/appliance. This way we can control which appliance
# gets the "dhcp_filename" option. This is to resolve a bug where setting
# the dhcp_filename option for devices like switches can cause problems for
# the devices
#
# Revision 1.21  2010/07/14 22:41:14  anoop
# Add the "kickstartable" attribute to appliances. Use this attribute
# to determine if insert-ethers needs to wait for a node to kickstart
# after getting an IP address
