# Revision 1.17  2009/03/13 18:45:59  mjk
# - rocks add host route works
# - added rocks.add.host.command class
# - getHostAttrs|Routes uses getHostname to normalize the host arg
# - fixed getHostRoutes
#
# Revision 1.16  2009/03/13 00:02:59  mjk
# - checkpoint for route commands
# - gateway is dead (now a default route)
# - removed comment rows from schema (let's see what breaks)
# - removed short-name from appliance (let's see what breaks)
# - dbreport static-routes is dead

# Revision 1.14  2008/08/28 22:04:49  bruno
# can now add entries to the networks table based on MAC. previously, we could
# only add entries with interface device name.
#
# 'rocks dump' now dumps info about nodes that have a MAC address but not an
# interface device name (e.g., 'remote management' and 'power units' nodes).
#
# Revision 1.13  2008/08/05 19:01:44  bruno
# add 'vlan' parameter

# embrace the anger
#
# Revision 1.10  2007/06/23 03:54:51  mjk
# - first pass at consistency
# - still needs some docstrings
# - argument processors take SQL wildcards
# - add cannot run twice (must use set)
# - dump does sets not just adds
#
# Revision 1.9  2007/06/19 16:42:40  mjk
# - fix add host interface docstring xml
# - update copyright
#
# Revision 1.8  2007/06/18 22:34:41  phil
# Rewrote add host interface to use set commands
# Fixed error in subnet
# Xrefs in ip
#
# Revision 1.7  2007/06/11 19:26:58  mjk
# - apache counts as root
# - alphabetized some help flags
# - rocks dump error on arguments
#
# Revision 1.6  2007/06/09 00:24:45  anoop
# Moving away from device names.
# Also adding interfaces should make sure that device names
# are checked before subnets. This should change in the future
# but absolutely vital now for things to stay stable
#
# Revision 1.5  2007/06/07 21:23:03  mjk
# - command derive from verb.command class
# - default is MustBeRoot
# - list.command / dump.command set MustBeRoot = 0
# - removed plugin non-bugfix
#
# Revision 1.4  2007/05/30 22:08:32  bruno
# added help
#
# Revision 1.3  2007/05/30 20:14:25  anoop
# Modified the "rocks add host interface" script rather heavily
# to know about and use the subnets table in the database. Trying
# to move towards device independance. Currently in Beta. Still needs
# heavy testing
#
# Revision 1.2  2007/05/10 20:37:00  mjk
# - massive rocks-command changes
# -- list host is standardized
# -- usage simpler
# -- help is the docstring
# -- host groups and select statements
# - added viz commands
#
# Revision 1.1  2007/04/18 22:03:44  bruno
# commands to add/remove host interfaces is now:
#
#     rocks add host interface
#     rocks remove host interface
#
# Revision 1.2  2007/04/18 22:00:11  bruno
# remove interfaces from the new rocks command line
#
# Revision 1.1  2007/04/18 21:43:43  bruno
# converted add-extra-nic to command line
