# Revision 1.4  2006/12/06 00:20:20  anoop
# All the Makefiles get a bit of an overhaul
#
# $(INSTALL) is used instead of install
# $(MAKE) is used instead of make or gmake
# $(TAR) is used instead of tar of gtar
#
# The mode argument for the $(INSTALL) command needs to be numeric and
# follow the convention of
#
# install [-cs] [-g group] [-m mode] [-o owner] file ...  destination
# install  -d   [-g group] [-m mode] [-o owner] dir
#
# This is portable across solaris and linux.
#
# Finally "tar xzf $TARFILE.tar.gz" is replaced with "gunzip -c $TARFILE.tar.gz | tar -xf -"
# This is again done for portability.
#
# This needs to be the convention from now on.
#
# Revision 1.3  2006/12/02 01:04:53  anoop
# Ridiculously big ass commit.
# Also known as the week after thanksgiving 2006. Or "The day Anoop
# broke Rocks".
#
# Main Changes.
#
# 1. Added a roll-profile.mk file. This is meant as a makefile for building
# the profile rpm containing all the XML files meant for the roll. This is a
# breakaway from the spec.in file method of building the profile RPM.
#
# 2. The variable PWD is now changed to CURDIR. The main reason for this is
# PWD is supplied by the shell. CURDIR is the variable supplied by gmake itself.
# This means we can have a slightly more platform independant way of doing things.
# Also Solaris was failing to set PWD correctly in the source directories, wreaking
# havoc on the location of the BUILD and PKG directories.
