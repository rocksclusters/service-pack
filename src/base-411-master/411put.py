#
# Revision 1.11  2010/11/20 20:57:49  bruno
# on a 'rocks sync config', we need to update /opt/rocks/etc/four11putrc
# with the private address and CIDR netmask to tell 411put where the local
# network is. without this assistance, 411put assumes eth0 is the private
# network and if the frontend has a bonded interface for the private network,
# then 411put will not know where to send its alerts.
#
# Revision 1.10  2010/10/20 21:26:08  mjk

# Added filter for auto.master
#
# Modified 411 transport to encode content of the file
# and filter before encrypting them. This helps with the
# problem of stripping whitespaces, and returns the content
# of the files exactly as they should be.
#
# Also modified the password and group filters just a little
# to make them return the correct whitespaces
#
# Revision 1.4  2008/07/17 01:29:40  anoop
# Changed 411put to use XML as transport rather than http style headers. This
# makes it significantly more flexible, to use and abuse. Adds python code
# that will filter the content of the file.

# 411 second generation: safer, thanks to master-only RSA keypair; all files
# are now signed for integrity. Faster for master, since we run the random
# number generator less (only once per cluster lifetime rather than once per
# encryption).  Keys are kept in /etc/411-security. Amen.
#
# Revision 1.6  2005/01/18 16:41:09  fds
# Use broadcast alert signaling rather than multicast. Now --name option respects
# group and chroot state.
#
# Revision 1.5  2004/11/29 20:57:23  fds
# Fix for bug 84. Simplify! Only use the dot-paths to prevent naming collisions
# in 411.d. Use native pathnames to actually write files. Specifically: the 411
# header contains the real path name, not the dot-path translation.
#
# This version of 411 is not compatible with past versions.

# 411 group support. Also cleaned out some depricated options.
#
# Revision 1.1  2004/05/25 02:31:05  fds
# Since becoming a 411-master is a job that should not be taken on lightly, we
# are moving the tools necessary for it into a separate package. These files are
# essentially unchanged from those in 'rocks-411', except the initscript, which
# is slightly simpler.
