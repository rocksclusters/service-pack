# Since becoming a 411-master is a job that should not be taken on lightly, we
# are moving the tools necessary for it into a separate package. These files are
# essentially unchanged from those in 'rocks-411', except the initscript, which
# is slightly simpler.

# Sending out alerts now so this service can be used as a "commit" for any
# changes to the /etc login files. Will put a bit more strain on the HTTP
# server at startup, but we have a backoff in the listener so lets use it.

# Commit facility is needed for passwd, groupadd cmd line tools that alter
# /etc login files but do not (yet) call 411put.
