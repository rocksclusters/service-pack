# Added filter for auto.master
#
# Modified 411 transport to encode content of the file
# and filter before encrypting them. This helps with the
# problem of stripping whitespaces, and returns the content
# of the files exactly as they should be.
#
# Also modified the password and group filters just a little
# to make them return the correct whitespaces
#
# Revision 1.1  2008/08/09 19:27:51  anoop
# beginning of actual usable 411 plugins. For now password and group file
# plugins
